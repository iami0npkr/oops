POLYMORPHISM 
Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on different forms or behave in different ways depending on the context in which they are used.

example: constructor overloading

1) compile time Polymorphism
2) Runtime polymorphism

COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM(statically ho jatha h)
1)constructor overloading(same constructor name but different parameters)
2)function overloading(same function name but different parameters inside a class)

RUN TIME POLYMORPHISM(dynamic polymorphism)

1) function overriding
Parent and child contain the same function with different 
implementation,child class given more priority
The parent class function is said to be overridden

overloading(in same class) vs overriding(due to inheritance)

2)Virtual functions

A virtual function is a member function that you expect to be redefined in derived classes.
Virtual function are dynamic in nature
Defined by the keyword "virtual" inside a base class and are always declared with a base class and overridden in a child class.
a virtual function is called during Runtime
