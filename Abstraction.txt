Abstration:
Hiding all unnecessary details & showing only the important parts
with the help of access modifiers

Abstraction:
using abstract classes
1) Abstract classes are used to provide a base class from which other classes can be derived;
2) They cannot be instantiated(objected) and are meant to be inherited.
3) Abstract classes are typically used to define an interface for derived classes.\
4) they are type of blueprints for derived classes
